# About the Project
This project is part of a 6-hour assessment that is meant to provide users a service to be able to reserve tickets for upcoming shows / performances by a set of performers. The web app interacts with the following [ticket-guru-service]("http://ec2-54-159-33-6.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5005/ticket-guru/api/docs") API.

# Installing Dependencies

## Front-End

In the `client` directory, run `yarn install` to install all dependencies for the front-end portion of the web app.

## Back-End

In the `server` directory, you must also `yarn install` to install dependencies for the server of the web app.

# Getting Started Locally

1. Open two consoles / terminals in the root directory of the project.
2. `cd` into the `server` directory in one of the terminal windows (after having run `yarn install`) and run the command `yarn start`.
3. In the second terminal window, `cd` into the `client` directory (after having run `yarn install`) and run the command `yarn start`.

# A Thank You

Thank you for the opportunity to continue this process with you and your team. This take home assignment was a lot of fun to work on. I will note that I was not able to get through the entire assignment within 6 hours. I hope that what is presented here is enough to showcase my technical skills.

Please let me know if there is anything else you may need from me. :)
